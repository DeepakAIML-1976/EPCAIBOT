3AUTO_GENERATED1. TQ-001: The vendor submission for VALVE1501 specifies a material group of "CARBON STEEL HIGH TEMP." whereas the datasheet specifies "CRNI-STEEL (ASME)". Please clarify the material group being offered.

2. TQ-002: The temperature limits for VALVE1501 in the vendor submission are stated as -29 to 425¬∞C, which deviates from the datasheet limits of -200 to 400¬∞C. Please confirm the correct temperature limits.

3. TQ-003: The vendor submission for VALVE1501 lists the body/bonnet material as "Material Group 1.2", while the datasheet specifies "Material Group 2.1 and 2.3". Please provide clarification on the material group.

4. TQ-004: The vendor submission for VALVE1501 indicates a trim analogous to API 600 No. 2, while the datasheet specifies trim analogous to API 600 No. 10. Please confirm the correct trim specification.

5. TQ-005: The vendor submission for VALVE1501 does not mention the extended bonnet length of L=300 as specified in the datasheet. Please confirm if this feature is included.

6. TQ-006: The vendor submission for VALVE1502 states a trim of "API 600 No. 10", which is not listed in the datasheet. The datasheet specifies trim as "API 600 No. 5 or 8". Please clarify the trim being offered.

7. TQ-007: The vendor submission for VALVE1502 lists the body/bonnet connection as "WELDED", while the datasheet specifies a "flanged" connection. Please confirm the correct connection type.

8. TQ-008: The vendor submission for VALVE1501 does not specify the fluid groups being addressed, which are fluid group 006 and fluid group 016 as per the datasheet. Please confirm the fluid compatibility.
